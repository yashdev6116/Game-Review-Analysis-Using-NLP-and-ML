# Game-Review-Analysis-Using-NLP-and-ML
Game Review Analysis using NLP and ML, where I analyzed game reviews to classify them as positive or negative sentiments. With a mix of NLP preprocessing and a Logistic Regression model, the project offers valuable insights into user sentiments.!!

This project focuses on analyzing and classifying game reviews into positive and negative sentiments using NLP and Machine Learning techniques. Here's a quick rundown of the project highlights:

Data Preprocessing: Performed tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, and punctuation removal to clean and prepare the text data.
Sentiment Analysis: Utilized TF-IDF for feature extraction and trained a Logistic Regression model to classify sentiments effectively.
Visual Insights: Visualized sentiment distribution to better understand the dataset.
Custom Predictions: Built a function to predict sentiment for user-inputted game reviews.
Tools and technologies used include Python, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and NLTK.
